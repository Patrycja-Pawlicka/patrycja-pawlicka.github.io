      <h2>My Coding Journey</h2>
      <p>
        I started looking into coding in early 2023 as a fun way to challenge myself and learn something completely new.
        Since I was always fascinated by game graphics and creative projects, programming felt like the next natural step.
        I initially dived into C#, but soon shifted my focus to the exciting world of HTML and CSS.
        As my skills grew, so did my hunger for knowledge, and I eagerly took on JavaScript as my next adventure.
        I've been hooked ever since, loving every moment of it.
        I'm now studying Computer Science at university, eager to turn this passion into a career where I can bring ideas to life on the web and beyond.

      <h2>More About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Beyond the screen and code, I'm all about creativity in every form.
        I love to draw, paint, and express myself through music — I play the guitar and I'm learning piano too.
        And when the mood hits, you can find me at karaoke with friends, singing my heart out.
        Yoga has also become a new favorite hobby, giving me space to decompress and reconnect with myself.
        I adore the outdoors just as much as I enjoy cozy gaming nights.
        But my biggest passion of all? Writing.
        I’ve explored many genres, but fantasy will always hold a special place in my heart.
