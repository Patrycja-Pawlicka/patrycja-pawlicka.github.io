### One Page Website

This is a single-page responsive website created using HTML and CSS. It features a clean, modern design and includes a homepage, a gallery of images, and an embedded video.
The goal of this project was to practice working with sections, navigation bars, responsive layouts, and media embedding.

### Movie Theater Site

This project is an example home page for a fictional movie theater. The website was designed using Bootstrap 4 to take advantage of its grid system, pre-built components, and responsive features.  
The project allowed me to explore how Bootstrap speeds up web design while keeping the site responsive and mobile-friendly.

### My First Website

This was my attempt at building a website from scratch using HTML and CSS.  
It served as a creative sandbox where I experimented with various HTML elements, basic CSS styling, layout techniques, and interactive features.  
While it started as a simple experiment, it ended up turning into a project I’m proud of—combining all the skills I learned into a playful and vibrant design that reflected my progress at the time and my creativity.
