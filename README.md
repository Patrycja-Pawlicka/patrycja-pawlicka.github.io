### One Page Website

This is a single-page responsive website created using HTML and CSS. It features a clean, modern design and includes a homepage, a gallery of images, and an embedded video.
The goal of this project was to practice working with sections, navigation bars, responsive layouts, and media embedding.

### Movie Theater Site

This project is an example home page for a fictional movie theater. The website was designed using Bootstrap 4 to take advantage of its grid system, pre-built components, and responsive features.  
The project allowed me to explore how Bootstrap speeds up web design while keeping the site responsive and mobile-friendly.
